# "CSS Project for Beginners"

### The pizza Shop ###

Starting from the <a href="https://github.com/mirkoeffe/WDEV-Course/tree/master/Projects/HTML_projects/web_shop"> Web Shop Project</a> I've implemented the CSS notions I've learned through the <a href="https://github.com/gitdagray/css_course">CSS Course</a>

So the final work is:

- Homepage with important informations about the Shop and the Menu
- Opening Hours Page with all the relative infos
- Contact Page with all the Shop infos
- About Page

But it's more styled and also curated with the possibility of light/dark mode
