<h2 align="center">Build a Product Landing Page</h2>

<b>Objective:</b> Build an app that is functionally similar to https://product-landing-page.freecodecamp.rocks

<b>User Stories:</b>

Your product landing page should have a ``header`` element with a corresponding ``id="header"``
You can see an image within the ``header`` element with a corresponding ``id="header-img"`` (A logo would make a good image here)
Within the ``#header`` element, you can see a ``nav`` element with a corresponding ``id="nav-bar"``
You can see at least three clickable elements inside the ``nav`` element, each with the class ``nav-link``
When you click a ``.nav-link`` button in the ``nav`` element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page
You can watch an embedded product video with ``id="video"``
Your landing page has a ``form`` element with a corresponding ``id="form"``
Within the ``form``, there is an ``input`` field with ``id="email"`` where you can enter an email address
The ``#email`` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for
The ``#email`` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address
Within the form, there is a submit ``input`` with a corresponding ``id="submit"``
When you click the ``#submit`` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: ``https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit``)
The ``navbar`` should always be at the top of the viewport
Your product landing page should have at least one media query
Your product landing page should utilize CSS flexbox at least once
Fulfill the user stories and pass all the tests below to complete this project. Give it your own personal style. Happy Coding!

Note: Be sure to add ``<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`` in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS

### This project can be implemented with JavaScript once I learn it and fix the nav-bar problem on being always on the left
