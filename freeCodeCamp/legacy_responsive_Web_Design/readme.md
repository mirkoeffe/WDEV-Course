# Legacy Responsive Web Design

### This is the old course about Web Design

- I've started the Legacy Responsive Web Design Course to refresh the memory about what I've learned, to try to learn new skills and notions that maybe I didn't and I will consider these as homeworks.

In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.

First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.
