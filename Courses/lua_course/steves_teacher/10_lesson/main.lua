-- Working with Files

-- io.output creates a new file in the working directory
-- if the file already exist it will be overwritten with a new one
--! io.output("myfile.txt")

-- io.write is used to write inside the newly created file
--! io.write("if you run the code you and then open the file you'll read this line!")

-- io.input([file]) it opens the named file (in text mode)
--! io.input("myfile.txt")

-- io.read Reads the file, according to the given formats, which specify what to read.
--! local fileData = io.read("*all")

--! print(fileData)

-- io.close closes the file, in order to allow other programs to access the file
--! io.close()
